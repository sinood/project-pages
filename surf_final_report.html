<br>
<p style='margin:0in;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>Linear perspective is a drawing technique that was discovered by Filippo Brunelleschi in Florence sometime in the early years of the 15<sup>th</sup> century. It was thereafter widely used throughout Europe to effectively portray 3D space in paintings, drawings, and prints before the invention of photography in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Existing literature on linear perspective in Renaissance and early modern art is vast and extends as far back as the early 20<sup>th</sup> century; but most of the scholarship has overlooked the fact that the use of linear perspective to portray and document real spaces often alters the appearance of those spaces.</p>
<br>
<p style='margin:0in;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>In 21<sup>st</sup> century scholarship, the art historian is no longer limited to working only with the objects that they happen to find before them in a single museum or archive. Online databases are becoming increasingly available and the number of digitized drawings and paintings continues to grow, yet we are still largely in need of ways in which to wrangle all this digitized visual and historical information with non-traditional, digital methods.</p>
<br>
<p style='margin:0in;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>My project takes a first step toward digitally analyzing an entire set of paintings and drawings that use linear perspective in order to understand how the technique discovered by Brunelleschi has had lasting effects on how real space was perceived and portrayed over time. My project presents to broader art historical and digital humanities scholarship a way in which digital methods can be used to extract information from paintings and drawings which the human eye cannot readily perceive, such as the viewpoint taken by the artist in real space, and further illuminate trends in the history of art that exist within a large set of images and which would otherwise pass unnoticed by historians.</p>
<br>
<h2 style='margin-top:2.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:0in;text-align:center;font-size:19px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black;'>Process and methods</h2>
<br>
<p style='margin:0in;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>The example I focused on in my summer research is the Piazza del Campidoglio in Rome and a set of about 60 drawings, paintings and prints of the Campidoglio that I identified in the first phase of my project.</p>
<br>
<p style='margin:0in;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>I completed preliminary research about the Piazza del Campidoglio&mdash;its urban history and its importance within the history of painting and print making in the early modern period. This allowed me to identify key historical events which may have influenced how the Campidoglio might be portrayed by artists as time went on, such as Michelangelo&rsquo;s redesigning of the Piazza in the 1530s and the eventual completion of the Palazzo Nuovo in 1655 (one of the two identical palaces flanking the Piazza, which did not exist before Michelangelo&rsquo;s redesign and was added to complete the symmetry of his new plan). I also searched various online archives for digitized paintings and drawings that would make up the body of my primary evidence. I located 66 images total between 1550 and 1950, and used 59 in my final analyses, excluding any images which may have been versions of the same drawing by a single artist.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p style='margin:0in;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>I traveled to Rome during the second phase of my project to obtain a 3D model of the Campidoglio using only a DSLR camera as my hardware equipment. With multiple sets of images, I could produce several 3D models of the Piazza using photogrammetry&mdash;a method for reconstructing the 3D shape of an object using many photos taken of that object from all around. The photogrammetry software I used to construct my models was Agisoft Metashape (Standard edition, version 1.8.3).</p>

        </table>
    </div>
    
<p style='margin:0in;text-align:center;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'><em>I obtained multiple 3D models over the course of a week of returning to the Piazza del Campidoglio to capture images of the square. The images were captured around midday and my final model used 140 images captured on a Canon EOS Rebel T3i at 18mm.</em></p>
<br>

        <div align="center">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td align="middle">
                <img src="img/Picture3.png" width="520px" />
            </tr>
        </table>

<p style='margin:0in;text-align:center;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'><em>View of the model&rsquo;s dense point cloud showing the location and orientation of every photo used to construct the model.</em></p>
<br>
<p style='margin:0in;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>In my third phase, I used the 3D model and the digitized historical images I collected to estimate the position in 3D space at which each artist would have portrayed the Campidoglio. To compute the estimated positions, I used a well-known computer vision technique called &ldquo;camera calibration&rdquo; or &ldquo;camera resectioning,&rdquo; which computes the original camera position given a handful of known 2D-3D point correspondences between the photograph (containing the 2D points) and the real-world scene (containing 3D points).</p>
<br>
<p style='margin:0in;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>The greatest problem with applying camera resectioning to hand-drawn images is that the Campidoglio as depicted by the artist and the real Campidoglio are not isometric&mdash;the artist may have skewed the proportions of the buildings, they might have used one vanishing point when photographs of buildings typically contain three, and so on. I found that camera resectioning could still produce an approximation of the artist&rsquo;s viewpoint that matches what we would expect when looking at their picture, so long as I chose my point correspondences carefully and treated each painting and drawing as if it were a photograph taken from the same camera.</p>
<br>
<p style='margin:0in;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>For consistency, I used my own DSLR camera settings in the camera resectioning algorithm, meaning I also had to crop and scale every sample image (the digitized paintings and drawings) to match the sensor dimensions on my camera (5184 x 3456 pixels). I then needed to produce the 2D-3D point correspondences using the processed sample images and my 3D model. On my 3D model, I marked the key points that appear in most paintings and drawings of the Campidoglio, such as the corners of the palaces, and saved the 3D coordinates of these points. Then, to obtain point correspondences with the historical images, I used a script that allowed me to manually identify the 2D location of those key points on each image and store all of the point correspondences in a data file.</p>

To estimate the artist&rsquo;s position, only 4-10 point correspondences were needed, with an ideal number of 6-8. Using too may or too few might result in an erroneous estimate for the artist&rsquo;s position.</em></p>

<br>
<p style='margin:0in;text-align:justify;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>I wrote further code to compute the estimated 3D position of each artist and plot these positions back onto my 3D model based on the gathered point correspondences. I used OpenCV&rsquo;s Python function &ldquo;solvePnP&rdquo; to compute the estimated positions given the 2D-3D correspondences.

In fact, most of the artists constructed their views from the studio, fabricating viewpoints that in real life might lie high in the sky (Dup&eacute;rac 1569) or in a location that is obstructed from a clear view of the Piazza (Caullery 1561). Instead, the estimated positions I obtained are meant to place the paintings and drawings in relation to one another according to the spatial construction used by each artist. This is enough to meaningfully observe changes in how artists went about constructing space in their pictures over time. &nbsp;</p>
